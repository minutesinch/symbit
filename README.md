## Install

- [Linux](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit/releases/latest/download/symbit-linux)
- [Mac](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit/releases/latest/download/symbit-macos)
- [Windows](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit/releases/latest/download/symbit-windows.exe)

NOTE: When downloading the Windows version, there may be a warning telling you that the program is harmful. Just ignore it because it's typical of Windows to do so ðŸ˜‰.

## Usage

### Linux + MacOS

For Linux and MacOS, it's super easy. You just have to open up a terminal in the directory you downloaded the latest version of Symbit from and do `./symbit-linux` and hit enter (or `./symbit-macos`) to run the program. If it doesn't work, you need to give it executable permissions. To do so, just type `chmod +x symbit-linux` (or `chmod +x symbit-macos`) in the terminal and hit enter.

### Windows

For Windows, you only need to click on the exe file after downloading it from the [releases](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit/releases/latest/download/symbit-windows.exe) page.

## About

TWRP has not been updated to support the new /system format and rooting has been more difficult. Although rooting with the stock bootloader usually brings more stability and less problems when rooting, it requires one to go through the hassle of typing many commands into the terminal just to be able to root or update their phone. This app aims to solve that problem.
